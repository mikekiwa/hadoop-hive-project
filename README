This file contains instructions on how to run the 2 Hive programs provided in this project. 

An input file is needed in order to run both scripts. Here is the instruction on how to generate one: 
- Run Python script randomDataGenerator.py. File input.tsv will be generated.
  $ python randomDataGenerator.py > input.tsv

An initialization script needs to be executed in order to create the underlying database and table structure for the 2 Hive programs below.
- Run Hive script init.hql by providing your HDFS directory as part of the hiveconf parameter HDFS_LOC and the data input file name as part of the hiveconf parameter INPUT_FILE. Here, HDFS_LOC is set to /user/ince/input, INPUT_FILE is set to input.tsv
  $ hive -hiveconf HDFS_LOC=/user/ince/input -hiveconf INPUT_FILE=input.tsv -f init.hql

—- Hive Programs in this Project —-
1. Most Popular Courses
- If not already done, execute the initialization step described above. Then, run Hive program mostPopularCourses.hql by providing N as part of the hiveconf variable N. Here, N is set to 3. Output file mostPopularCoursesOutput.tsv will be generated.
  $ hive -hiveconf N=3 -f mostPopularCourses.hql > mostPopularCoursesOutput.tsv


2. Consumption Summary per Course
-  If not already done, execute the initialization step described above. Then, run Hive program consumptionSummary.hql. 
  Output file consumptionSummaryOutput.tsv will be generated in the second hive call. See consumptionSummary.hql for details on why the output file generation is executed as an additional step.
  $ hive -f consumptionSummary.hql > consumptionSummaryOutput.tsv
  $ hive -e 'SELECT * FROM videoDB.course_activity' > consumptionSummaryOutput.tsv
